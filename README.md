C# WPF-Flighttower
==================
This is a school-project I did for a course at Malm√∂ University in Sweden.
It is a Flight Tower program written in C# and displays data in a WPF(Windows Presentation Foundation).
When the program starts a flight tower window is displayed. When button "Send next plane to runway"
is pressed then a second flight WPF-window is displayed where you can decide if you like to start the plane
, land the plane or change direction for the plane.
In the Flight window application event-delegates are implemented that the flight tower application
subscribes to. When a button i pressed in the flight window application then an event is sent to 
the flight tower application.
